# Hard-work-and-dedication
This is my heart and soul in an app I am putting together all my current knowledge of html, css, node, express, and javascript to bring my dream into reality please look at my thoughts.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, and OAuth
I am combining all the tools I have gathered from my time of being a Resilient Coder and I am pouring it all out here and now this is a preview of my final project and what will hopefully be brought to Andriod and iOS devices. I want to make a community that can share information about up and coming leagues, open gym, and tournament play. Too many times open gyms are left empty cause people don't know about them and I plan to but forth a movement to change that get people active and help do what I can to potentially save a life.

## Optimizations
I am still learning back end work and I am going to learn put forth the work to learn iOS and Andriod compatible languages so I can complete my ultimate gola of making this an app for not only my community but the world. With a large support base already just from a group I created on facebook I know this app will have an impact and be something we haven't had before.

## Lessons Learned:
I have learned how to use OAuth and this is huge in my development I because knowing how many people use facebook and other social media outlets I can connect people who have social media and those that don't. This is a gap that I intend to fill in the lack of communication.
## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
